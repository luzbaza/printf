DESCRIPTION
Printf project done for the Holberton School.
_printf() receives the format argument as a string and prints to standard output based on the arguments following it. The following are the specifiers that convert those arguments to be printed.

 CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
The following characters act as specifiers for the conversions to be performed:
c
Arguments of type int are converted to type char and printed to standard output.
s
Arguments of type const char * are expected to be a pointer to an array of type char. All characters in the array, except the final null byte, are printed to standard output.
 d,i


RETURN VALUE
On success returns the number of characters to print, excluding the terminating null byte of the strings.
Returns -1 if NULL or just '%' is passed.
If NULL is passed as an argument to a string it is printed (null).
